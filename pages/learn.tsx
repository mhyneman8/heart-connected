						text='The anatomical heart consists of four chambers. The upper chambers, or atria, which receive blood from the body and lungs; and the lower chambers, or ventricles, which send blood to the body and the lungs. The heart functions as the pump and connection between these two different systems to obtain oxygen from the lungs and deliver it to all the other organs, like the brain, stomach, kidneys, and more. In normal anatomy, the right atrium receives blood from the body and directs it to the right ventricle which sends blood via the pulmonary arteries to the lungs for oxygenation. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood, directing it to the left ventricle which sends the blood via the aorta to the rest of the body.'

						Early cardiac development begins with single triple-layer pipe that

						and venous pole and slow rhythmic contractions. Soon after the four
						chambers begin to differentiate, and the pulmonary vessels form and
