			'While one percent of all children are born with congenital heart disease, the term \'rare\' often isolates parents, families, and children dealing with CHD, leaving them feeling helpless. Regardless of the disease\'s classification, whether mild or severe, parents of children with CHD are at risk of developing a traumatic response upon receiving the diagnosis. Our website aims to create a local and expand the national community surrounding CHD, ensuring that no parent, child, or sibling feels alone. Although the congenital heart disease community is strong and supportive, navigating through resources and information can be challenging. We aspire for this website to serve as a central hub, promoting fantastic organizations tirelessly working to enhance care for both CHD patients and their families.',
