                        Early cardiac development begins with single triple-layer pipe that twists 
                        and folds upon itself creating a heart tube with an arterial and venous pole 
                        and slow rhythmic contractions. Soon after the four chambers begin to 
                        differentiate, and the pulmonary vessels form and attach to the left atrium.

                    This is a result of cushions that fuse and form the walls separating the heart

                    Inappropriate outflow development can also lead to misplacement of the coronary artery 
                    (vessels supplying the heart muscle). In the final stages of structural 
                    development, atrioventricular (AV) and semi-lunar valves form. Valve formation 
                    defects include Ebsteinâ€™s anomaly or a bicuspid (two leaf, rather than the 
                    expected three leaf) aortic valve, which can present with early tricuspid 
                    incompetency, aortic calcification, and/or heart failure. (Buijtendijk et al., 2020)
