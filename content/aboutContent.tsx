			'One percent of all children are born with a congenital heart disease. Yet, we often use words like “rare” to define them leaving parents and families isolated and helpless. Whether the disease is classified as mild or severe, CHD parents are at risk of developing a traumatic response just from being told the diagnosis, let alone the other events that are often associated with CHD care. Our hope through the development of this website is to build a local and expand on the national community around CHD so no parent, child, or sibling feels alone. The congenital heart disease community is strong and supportive, but finding the right resources and sifting through all the information out there can be difficult. We hope that this website can serve as a central hub that promotes the already fantastic organizations that have been tireless working to improve care, for both the patients and families of CHD. Through education, compassion, and a united community, we aim to transform fear into resilience, uncertainty into hope, and isolation into connection. Together, we envision a world where the journey of CHD is met with understanding, strength, and unwavering support.',

			'Our vision at Heart Connected is a world transformed by compassion, knowledge, and unity. We envision a future where the burden of congenital Heart Disease (CHD) is significantly reduced, and individuals and families facing this diagnosis find solace in a community that understands, empowers, and supports them. In this world, the trauma response to a CHD diagnosis is replaced with resilience, hope, and strength. We see a society where every child born with CHD has access to the best possible care, where their families are equipped with the information and resources they need to make informed decisions, and where the journey of CHD is met with unwavering support and camaraderie. With your partnership, we are working tirelessly to turn this vision into reality, one heart at a time.',
